# 📊 AI-Powered Stock Valuation (DCF Model)

This project uses **Python + Google Colab + Excel** to perform **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation** of stocks.  
It automatically fetches financial data using `yfinance`, calculates fair value, and exports results into Excel for easy analysis.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Fetches stock data (via Yahoo Finance API).
- Runs **DCF Valuation** with adjustable parameters:
  - Growth Rate
  - WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital)
  - Terminal Growth
  - Forecast Years
- Exports results to **Excel** (`DCF_Results.xlsx`).
- Open-source and reproducible (Colab notebook included).
